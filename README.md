  ## Description
  
  This is a portfolio that uses MERN to launch an application with all of my favorite projects!

  ## General Information
  
  ### Installation
  
  To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  
  ```npm i```

  ### Usage 
  
  The navigation will bring you to various parts of the portfolio. You can send me a message or even look at some of my projects. Deployed links are anchored into the screenshots. 
  
  ### Mobile-First Design
  
  My portfolio was designed with a Mobile-First Design. As you can see the Projects section looks different in the Mobile version as it does in the Desktop version. Mobile CSS is built into the React portfolio's main CSS and Desktop CSS is added on top for screens at least 500px.
