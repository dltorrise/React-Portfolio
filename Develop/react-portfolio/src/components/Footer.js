import React from 'react';

export default function Footer() {

      <h5>This portfolio was generated with MERN technology</h5>
      <p>
      WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developerâ€™s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
</p>
    </div>
